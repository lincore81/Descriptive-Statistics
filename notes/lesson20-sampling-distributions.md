1. We can compare a sample with the population of all samples by comparing the mean of the sample to the others.
2. The probability of rolling at least a 3 on a D4 is `2/4 = 0.5`.
3. The mean of the population `1, 2, 3, 4` (vertices on a D4) is the sum of the population `10` divided by N `4`: `10 / 4 = 2.5`.
4. We take all possible samples of 2 D4 rolls, its population size N is 16, because 4 possible values times 4 possible values equal 16 outcomes: `[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]`
5. We calculate the mean for each sample: `[1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0]`
6. We calculate the mean of all sample means, which is `2.5`. *Observation: The mean of sample means is identical to the mean of the population.*
