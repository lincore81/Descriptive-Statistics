## Constructs

"Constructs are mental abstractions that we use to express the ideas, people, organisations, events and/or objects/things that we are interested in" [[1]](http://dissertation.laerd.com/constructs-in-quantitative-research.php). Constructs are usually not directly observable or consist of observable things.

### Some examples for constructs are:
- Einstein's Theory of General Relativity
- Age
- Height
- DNA
- Trees
- A Forest

### Why should we be concerned with the definition for a construct?
Constructs are very efficient way to think about and communicate complex and abstract ideas. When I say that I have relationship issues, even a stranger has a rough understanding of what that entails. However, that can also be a disadvantage when clarity and precision are important, like they are in statistics. When we discuss constructs, misunderstandings are common, because we express abstract and complex subjects in few words.

## Operational definitions
Operational definitions allow us to define constructs in terms of concrete, unambiguous, quantifiable data. For instance, a possible operational definition for *age* might be *the amount of years passed since birth*. However, this is only one of many possibilities. While we are used to associate variables like *body length in cm/in* with constructs such as *height*, there are not the only ones. Which definition to choose dependes on the subject matter and what aspects we are interested in.

### More examples:

| Construct | Operational Definition (one of many possible) |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Wealth    | Yearly income in â‚¬/USD |
| Happiness | Amount of chocolate eaten in gramms per day  |
| Green     | Wavelength of reflected light is between 495 and 570 nm |
| Forest    | Squirrel pop. density at least 10/km^2 |
| Memory    | Number of wedding days forgotten in a row |
